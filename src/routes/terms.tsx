      <h2>The documentation site</h2>
      <p>
        This site is provided for informational purposes. The content is published as-is without
        warranty of any kind. We make every effort to keep documentation accurate against the
        current release, but the source code in the repository is the canonical reference.
      </p>

      <h2>The software</h2>
      <p>
        ELIPS is open-source software developed in public on GitHub. A formal licence file is not
        yet present in the repository — until one is added, treat the source code's repository terms
        as the canonical statement and consult the maintainers before redistribution. Nothing on
        this site grants additional rights beyond what the repository itself grants.
      </p>

      <h2>Trademarks</h2>
      <p>
        "ELIPS" and the ELIPS wordmark refer to the open-source project and its associated
        community. Other names and marks referenced across the documentation belong to their
        respective owners.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>
        These terms may be updated to reflect changes to the project or the way the documentation
        site is operated. Material changes will be noted in the <a href="/changelog">changelog</a>.
