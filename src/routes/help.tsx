      <h2>
        <code>ConfigError</code> on reopen
      </h2>
      <p>
        The most common cause is a dimension or metric mismatch against the on-disk{" "}
        <code>IDENTITY</code>. Inspect it:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock lang="bash">{`elips info /path/to/db`}</CodeBlock>
      <p>
        Pass the values from <code>IDENTITY</code> when calling <code>open()</code>, or omit them
        entirely — existing databases always reopen with their persisted identity. A second cause is
        a Python callable embedder that was not provided on reopen.
      </p>

      <h2>
        <code>LockConflict</code>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Another process holds the write lock on the database directory. Find it with{" "}
        <code>lsof &lt;db&gt;/LOCK</code> on Linux/macOS. If the previous owner crashed, the OS
        releases the lock automatically.
      </p>

      <h2>WAL replay aborts</h2>
      <p>
        Run <code>elips verify</code> to print the recovered prefix and confirm any tail truncation:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock lang="bash">{`elips verify /path/to/db`}</CodeBlock>

      <h2>Slow first query</h2>
      <p>
        HNSW graphs are warm-loaded on first use. Subsequent queries hit the resident graph and are
        sharply faster. If you serve from cold starts often, consider a warm-up query at process
        start.
      </p>

      <h2>Still stuck?</h2>
      <p>
        Open an{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/axiomchronicles/ellips/issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          issue
        </a>{" "}
        with the output of <code>elips info</code>, your config, and a minimal reproduction. See
        also the <Link to="/faq">FAQ</Link>.
